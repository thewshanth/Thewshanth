👋 About Me

Hi, I'm Thewshanth Sivagnanam — an aspiring Cybersecurity Analyst with a strong foundation in networking, security operations, and hands-on technical problem-solving. I enjoy combining my academic background with personal lab work to sharpen my skills and stay up to date in the ever-evolving world of cybersecurity.

I'm currently progressing through the Google Cybersecurity Certificate to further develop my understanding of security fundamentals, while actively gaining practical experience through:

TryHackMe and Hack The Box labs for hands-on cybersecurity training

OverTheWire (Bandit) challenges for strengthening Linux command-line skills

I’ve also completed various home lab projects ranging from Python simulations to network and SIEM setups. These projects not only demonstrate my technical capabilities but also reflect my passion for learning by doing.
